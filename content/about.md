Iâ€™m a Security Researcher, Penetration Tester and Developer. I love to break things and I get overly excited whenever a shell pops up. As part of my development madness, Iâ€™m quite familiar with:

- PHP
- Python
- Java
- C
- Haskell
- Rust - still learning
- Golang - in a clunky way

As for the infosec part of my job, Iâ€™m used to deal with:

- Appsec - Any language or product, in every form/aberration.
- IoT/Mobile Penetration testing
- Netsec
- OSINT
- Social engineering
- Reverse engineering
- Red teaming

Since 2018, I got my OSCP certification.

In the spare time I like to do CTF challenges and play games, mostly FPS, MMORPG, Survivals and Simulation. I should touch the grass, also ðŸŒ²
