      <description>Preface This is a brief story about a phishing attempt made by a user that turned out into a little research.
The initial contact The first contact I had was with a profile named Abigail🌻 who sent me a friend invite on steam.
After a few minutes I received a message from the user, asking for a vote on a specific CS:GO AK-47 skin. Unfortunately I didn&amp;rsquo;t take screenshot of the conversation because I got blocked and the messages are gone.</description>

      <description>Introduction While doing some research about file formats, I occasionally found some references about the DICOM file format. Since I never heard about it I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to dig deeper.
16/02/2024 Update It seems that the developer was already aware of the Double-Free issue since it has been reported a few weeks ago and it&amp;rsquo;s ready to be merged into the main branch. The issue has been reported in the following Github issue - Double Free and Github Issue - Floating point.</description>

      <description>This is a brief story about how a vulnerability on a drupal plugin has been found, which, when not configured correctly, could allow an authenticated user to perform a privilege escalation attack on the Drupal platform. This plugin, as stated in the usage section of the drupal website, is used by roughly 522 websites in the current month (June 2021) - ranging from version 7.x to 8.x Plugin stats.
Some history and background SAML is a recognized and widely adopted security standard used by web applications for authenticating and authorizing users.</description>

      <title>Matrix Synapse 1.12.3 - SSRF and Cache poisoning</title>
      <link>https://voidzone.me/posts/matrix-synapse-ssrf-cache-poisoning/</link>

      <guid>https://voidzone.me/posts/matrix-synapse-ssrf-cache-poisoning/</guid>
      <description>tl;dr The Matrix Synapse servers have been found affected by a security issue about the lack of a validation system for &amp;ldquo;Server-to-server&amp;rdquo; API leading to SSRF and Cache poisoning subsequently marked by the team as “feature” or “intended”. In short, a malicious user, if not specifically denied by configuration files, could effectively load malicious content using what is called the “Server-To-Server” API and, since the caching mechanism allows a lifetime of 24h, it could allow to host arbitrary files for that duration.</description>

      <title>CVE-2018-20139 - Daikin Emura Series - Arbitrary Remote Control via DNS Rebinding</title>
      <link>https://voidzone.me/posts/cve-2018-2013-daikin-emura-series-arbitrary-remote-control-dns-rebinding/</link>

      <guid>https://voidzone.me/posts/cve-2018-2013-daikin-emura-series-arbitrary-remote-control-dns-rebinding/</guid>
      <description>There is a lot of hype around DNS rebinding vulnerability and vulnerable IoT devices, including home cameras, air conditioners or climate control devices; this flaw will cover the lack of origin checking on HTTP requests.
DNS Rebinding Attack DNS Rebinding allows an attacker who has control on a DNS server to communicate with a device connected to the internal network of the victim.
Normally, these kind of attacks are mitigated by the Same-Origin policy header, implemented by most of the browsers, that will block every attempt to load external content that does not belong to the original domain.</description>

      <title>Facebook chat / dashboard content injection</title>

      <guid>https://voidzone.me/posts/facebook-chat-dashboard-content-injection/</guid>
      <description>Some time ago a friend of mine was spear-phished with a message through the Facebook chat, this happened before Facebook patched the chat application, allowing to exchange of messages only between people connected as friends. While I was analyzing the message, I noticed that it looked like a legit message, with a link to a newspaper page, a title, body and image, but also with a pseudo-random generated domain like the killswitch domain used by WannaCry ransomware, written in a small gray text area below the description.</description>
